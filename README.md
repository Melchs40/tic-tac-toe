# tic-tac-toe

The purpose of this project is to create an interactive tic tac toe board for two people to play against one another and even perhaps against a computer opponent. This project will use the knowledge I've gained on constructors, modules, and factory functions. I hope it will allow for me to work on creating easier to read code that will be able to be manipulated much easier.
